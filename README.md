# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning is a supervised learning project aimed at predicting whether an individual is diabetic or not based on medical diagnostic measurements. The model is trained using the popular Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

In this project:

We use Python for implementation

Data preprocessing and exploration are done using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib

The prediction is made using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 78%â€“82%, depending on the train-test split

This project is a practical application of ML in the healthcare domain, helping raise awareness of early diagnosis.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Used
- **Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Accuracy:** ~80% on test data
- **Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
